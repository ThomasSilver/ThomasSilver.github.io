                <h1 data-brackets-id="11">What Is El Niño?</h1>
                <p data-brackets-id="12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El Niño is a climate cycle that occurs in the Pacific Ocean. It is a global phenomenon that occurs during our winter and, for the most part, brings warmer temperatures, but it has a variety of effects throughout the world. It causes drier and colder weather in the Northern US, drier and warmer weather in the Southern US, warmer, wet weather in Central and South America, and more adverse effects around the globe, creating floods, droughts, monsoons, fires, and more. They typically last nine to twelve months and appear every two to seven years. </p>

                  <h1 data-brackets-id="15">How Does It Occur?</h1>
                <p data-brackets-id="16">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, trade winds from the Pacific blow to the West, bringing the warm water towards the Eastern Hemisphere. During an El Niño, those trade winds weaken, and the winds pushing east towards the Western Hemisphere overpower them. Because of that, the wind starts to push the warmer water to the east instead of to the west, the way it should be going. That creates higher pressure near Canada and lower pressure in the US, which is what causes the drastic climate change. This also happens in the Eastern Hemisphere because it isn’t getting the warm water it’s supposed to be getting.</p>

                  <h1 data-brackets-id="20">Why is this a problem?</h1>
                <p data-brackets-id="21">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of problems that El Niño causes other than the weather and natural disasters themselves, especially in Bangladesh. It was found that in Bangladesh, eleven months after the first effects of El Niño were witnessed, there was a major increases in cholera cases than normal. After some research, it was found that it was due to El Niño. El Niño also causes a problem with Bangladesh’s drinking water. El Niño brings monsoons to Bangladesh which make it easier for the inhabitants to get poisoned. Lastly, the warmer water near Bangladesh lowers the amount of nutrients, killing off the phytoplankton that fish feed off of. This makes food for fish scarce, forcing them to move to find more, decreasing the population of fish in the area near Bangladesh and the total population since a lot of fish die trying to find more food.</p>
